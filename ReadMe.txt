NetCausality: A time-delayed neural network tool for causality detection and analysis

================================

NetCausality is a software developed in MATLAB to detect causality between systems.
The software has been developed to be flexible and any number of time series can be analysed togheter. 
Each time series can be compounded by an any number of signals. 

The software has three different tools: Causality Detection, Time Horizon Detection and Causality Feature Detection.

For information about the potentialities of each tool, please refer to the article "NetCausality: A time-delayed neural network tool for causality detection and analysis".

For information about the running of the software tool, please see the "NetCausality - User Manual" in the folder "docs". 


Installation instructions
